Hey   
I'm Jayanth Boddu, and I've made it my mission to drag Seismic Imaging into the AI age, kicking and screaming, if necessary. At the intersection of Geophysics, Deep Learning, Computer Vision & Full stack Software Development, I'm building a future where AI accelerates sustainable energy discovery. Armed with a data science toolkit and an unquenchable deep learning obsession, I break barriers between academic papers and the gritty reality of energy exploration, one use case at a time. Currently, I'm spearheading initiatives to democratise AI based automation for geophysicists and developing scalable solutions that fundamentally transform how our industry processes seismic data.
